This is a jquery plugin for getting and selecting text in form fields 
and/or setting/getting the current cursor (caret) position in a field.

It does basically the same thing as the jcaret plugin by C.F. Wong but
I wanted to get some practice writing a jQuery plugin from scratch.
The plugin adheres to the standard jquery plugin format as per the
jQuery documentation.

Here's a list of all the ways that you can call the plugin:

$(blah).caret()
   Returns an array w/ 2 elements which indicate the start and end
   positions of the currently highlighted text.

$(blah).caret( [startPos, endPos] )
$(blah).caret( startPos, endPos )
$(blah).caret( {start: startPos, end: endPos} )
   Highlights the text between startPos and endPos.

$(blah).caret( 'text' )
   Returns the currently highlighted text

$(blah).caret( 'text', str ) 
   Replaces the currently highlighted text with 'str'.

$(blah).caret( 'find', findVal )
   Highlights text by searching for a string or evaluating a regular
   expression.  findVal can be either a string or a javascript regexp.


These methods are strictly for positioning the caret w/ no selection:
   
$(blah).caret( pos )
   Sets the caret to position pos. 

$(blah).caret( 'start' )
   Positions the caret to the beginning of the text.

$(blah).caret( 'end' )
   Positions the caret to the end of the text.
